**`Junior Developer`**

I'm a junior software engineer at the start of my journey - aiming to bring a positive change through my work. 
All coding projects are built from scratch, from planning and designing to solving real-life problems with code.
Always aiming to enhance my knowledge base by learning more languages and applying them immediately.
